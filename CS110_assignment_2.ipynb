You also need to apply the concepts of priority queues and heaps discussed in class in the context of a single day task scheduler. This assignment builds on the simple scheduler studied in lesson 4.1, “Heaps and priority queues”.  \n",
        "\n",
        "You are now asked to create your own list of tasks, with their durations and task dependencies.  Your list of tasks must include activities that you plan to perform in a day in your rotation city. Include at least 3 activities that are culturally specific to your rotation city (e.g., if you're in Tokyo, you might be interested in enjoying the cherry (sakura) blossom season). \n",

        "Your task scheduler receives a list of tasks to be performed in a day.  The input list of tasks has the form:\n",
        "\n",
        "<h5><center>Task_ID | Task Description | Task Duration | List of Task Dependencies | Task Status</center></h5>\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "* **Task Duration** in minutes. Duration of the task in minutes.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Dependencies.** This is a list of Task IDs indicating whether the current task cannot begin until all of its dependencies have been completed (e.g. one cannot eat gogigui unless one has already found a restaurant in Seoul, has arrived at a restaurant, has gotten a table, has ordered, etc.)\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Status.** A task is one of these states: $NOT-YET-STARTED$, $IN-PROGRESS$, or $COMPLETED$.\n",
        "\n",
        "With an input list of tasks as described above, your scheduler needs to use a priority queue, implemented with either a $MAXHEAP$ or a $MINHEAP$ depending on your implementation, to plan the execution of the tasks. Please note that for this assignment, you are expected to write your own heap/priority queue implementation (rather than using the heapq module we have used in class).\n",

        "### Criteria for scheduling tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Like in the example in class, we assume that all tasks have the same priority. Thus, your scheduler will begin scheduling tasks by first looking at which tasks are ready to be executed and added to the priority queue as soon as all their dependencies have been satisfied.\n",

        "You may consider a different criterion for deciding which task is tackled first among tasks\n",
